<p>Hello and welcome, I&rsquo;m Juan. And this is my weblog about the upcoming adventures I will embark on in cyberspace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently decided that I want to become a software engineer. In order for this to happen, I must engineer software. Something I&rsquo;ve learned about learning is that quantity trumps quality time and time again. Given that repetition is the one true master, my focus will be on delivering as many products as my fingers can output.</p>
<p>There will be a strong focus on backend web development (it&rsquo;s my jam), but I have many passions especially around future technology and physics.</p>
<p>Having somewhere to document all of this seemed like a good idea. Making somewhere to document all of this seemed like an even better one. The blog was an obvious solution.</p>
<p>Let me explain why I chose the stack I did.</p>
<p>My entire stack consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugo</li>
<li>Github Pages</li>
</ul>
<p>That is it!</p>
<p>Thanks to command-line support all the work is being done from a terminal window.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writting this post from my terminal using vim.</p>
<p>I will compile the site from my terminal using hugo.</p>
<p>Then I will push the changes to GitHub using their terminal client.</p>
<hr>
<p>I understand what Leonardo da Vinci meant when he said &ldquo;Simplicity is the ultimate sofistication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very distractable person. Getting rid of everything I don&rsquo;t need is required for me to do work. I hope writing this blog will help me find all the cargo I don&rsquo;t need, and turn it to jetsam.</p>
<p>I wish to be able to contribute to simplifying the world, to help myself and others by minimizing the amount of headaches caused by over-thinking and complexity.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll be around for the ride.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, be well.</p>
